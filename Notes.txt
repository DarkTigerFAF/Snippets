1<<m -> 2^m
Gray Code : x ^ x>>1
Knights can attack each other in 2x3 / 3x2 board
Square numbers have odd no. of factors
(i + j) mod 3 (adjacent diagonals)
When doing knapsack start from the biggest number and check if depth left is enough
No. of divisors of number = p1^(a+1) * p2^(a+1) p(distinct prime factor)
Unimodel permuation are permutation with 1 peak, to count them : 2^n-1
Rules function seres nth term equals number of setbits in n ^ (n - 1)
Comparator function:
(a < b) increasing
(a > b) decreasing
Polygon Radius = s / (2 * sin(180 / n)) * cos(180 / n);

Area of parallelogram:
A = 1/2 * (((AxBy)+(BxCy)+(CxDy)+(DxAy))-((AyBx)+(ByCx)+(CyDx)+(DyAx)))

Area of triangle using sides:
A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), s = (a + b + c) / 2

Area of sector:
ceta / 360 * pi * r^2

Angle in triangle using sides:
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(ceta)
